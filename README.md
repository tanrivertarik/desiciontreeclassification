## Decision Tree Classification

This project implements a decision tree algorithm for classification tasks. Decision trees are a popular machine learning technique for building models that predict a discrete outcome based on a set of features.

### Project Overview

This project includes:

* Implementation of a decision tree classifier from scratch (optional)
* Integration with scikit-learn library for decision tree classification (recommended)
* Functions for training, evaluating, and visualizing the decision tree
* Example usage demonstrating how to apply the decision tree to a classification problem

### Dependencies

This project may require the following libraries:

* scikit-learn ([https://scikit-learn.org/](https://scikit-learn.org/)) (for scikit-learn integration)
* ... (list any other dependencies)

**Note:** If implementing the decision tree from scratch, additional libraries may be needed for data manipulation and visualization.

### Usage

1. **Installation:**
    * Ensure required libraries are installed (`pip install scikit-learn` etc.)
    * Clone or download this project.

2. **Training:**
    * Prepare your data (features and target variable).
    * Use the provided functions to train the decision tree model on your data.
    * You can choose between implementing the decision tree from scratch or using scikit-learn's implementation.

3. **Evaluation:**
    * Evaluate the performance of the model on a hold-out test set.
    * Functions are provided to calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

4. **Prediction:**
    * Use the trained model to predict the class labels for new data points.

5. **Visualization (optional):**
    * Functions are provided to visualize the decision tree structure for better understanding.

### Examples

See the provided example scripts or notebooks for demonstrations on how to use the decision tree for classification tasks.

### Documentation

* Refer to scikit-learn documentation for detailed information on decision tree parameters and functionalities ([https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html)).
* Additional resources on decision trees can be found online (e.g., [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree)).
